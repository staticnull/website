    Today, the world recognizes this truth: Open Source represents industrial- strength, secure, fully-endorsed software solutions that are used across industries and throughout organizations worldwide.

    Over twenty years ago, we embraced Open Source as a cost-effective alternative to commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS), enabling us to build scalable enterprise-class solutions for our clients.

    Since 1993, our teams have been active contributors in the development, incubation, and advancement of Open Source technologies and engineering services, serving Fortune 500 companies locally and around the globe. We built and actively support a suite of Open Source products, including Grails, OpenDDS, TAO, and JBoss.
