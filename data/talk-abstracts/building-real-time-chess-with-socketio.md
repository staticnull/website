Socket.io is a real-time engine for Node.js. You can use it to build amazing real-time Node apps really simply. Let's build a real-time multiplayer chess game together, using Node, Express and Socket.io from scratch. We'll start by building a basic Express web app hosting a local chess game. Next we'll make it multiplayer adding Socket.io; when you make a move it's reflected on your opponent's screen in real-time without any refresh. We'll finish by publishing it online so you can play with your friends. It will be sweet because you'll learn about websockets and Socket.io by building this fun game, and it's a good way to learn some basics of Node apps if you're a beginner.
