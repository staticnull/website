Are you new to JavaScript? New to testing? Then start building good test habits right away by writing your own code challenges. When designing code challenges/puzzles, the goal is to think up a good problem to solve, and then figure out how to test a user's answer. Bonus points if you solve your own challenge, but in reality, if you learn to write good tests you don't even need to know how to solve your own challenges. This talk will walk you through how to write code challenges, how to use Chai.js for testing, and where you can submit your own challenges to share with the world. TDD is fun; test-driven learning (TDL) for beginners is even better!
