I hope you're excited about testing! We all know we need to get testing better, but it can be really hard to know how and what to test. We'll learn about the three inputs to React components (user input, props, and data) and how to test for each of them. You'll discover that if you slightly modify the way you're writing your components, you can make them much easier to test. We'll be using the new super fast AVA testing framework and even see how to add code coverage with nyc.

I hope you like code. You're gonna see some here!
