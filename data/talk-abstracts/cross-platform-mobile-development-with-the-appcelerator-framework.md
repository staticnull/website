Creating enterprise-caliber mobile applications presents a myriad of problems. One of those problems is having an entirely separate team of developers with an entirely separate skillset for each platform on which you'd like your app to work. Cross-platform mobile development seeks to alleviate this problem. In this talk, we'll take a deep-dive into the Appcelerator platform. We'll take an in-depth look at the Appcelerator approach to solving this problem, as well as briefly touch upon native development and other technologies' cross-platform solutions and when each one may be appropriate to use. We'll also go over some best practices for Appcelerator development for the enterprise environment and take a tour through the Appcelerator tools.
